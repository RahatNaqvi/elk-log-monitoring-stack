* Docker Compose

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/elk-log-monitoring-stack.git
   cd elk-log-monitoring-stack
   ```

2. Build and start the stack:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. Access Kibana at `http://localhost:5601` to visualize your logs.

## Usage
